# Concentration

CS193P IOS Application Development Assignment I: Concentration

## Differences

There are several differences between my app and Assignment requirements

1. When Card is face up, it will be disabled.
  * If it is matched, it will keep that state.
  * Or it will face down and enable.
2. Adding a label for showing game Time, but I forget how to show. So it is in TODO.
  * In Concentration, I add isFinished, a computed proprety, to check wheather all card is matched.
  * In ConcentrationViewController, I add isGaming to start game time or stop it.
